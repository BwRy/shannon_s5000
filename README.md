# Shannnon S5000 Skeleton
A source-code directory skeleton for the Shannon baseband. Extracted from over 150K debugging messages in the baseband itself.
Files contain the debugging messages themselves and a line number, but **no actual compilable source code is provided**.

For research purposes only.
